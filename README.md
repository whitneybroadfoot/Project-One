This application puts K9 info all in one place which creates a time saving experience for the user. The application deploys four articles at a time, all referencing stories that are related to dogs and puppies. There are also additional sections that provide fun quotes, an image search, and outside links. There are hundreds of webpages for dog owners and lovers, with Happy Tales, they are streamlined into one relavant list.
